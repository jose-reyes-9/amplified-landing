<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to our about page! I am Jose Reyes, and this is my
partner Samir Bawezir, together we have created Amplified. We are both students
at Woodbridge Senior High School, and we started developing Amplified our
sophomore year. It has been a long journey, but we are still far from done. Below,
you can read the story of Amplified, as well as our individual descriptions!</p>

<h1>The Story of Amplified</h1>
<br />

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>Samir came up with the idea after hearing countless students complain about
  their learning environments, and how little say they have in their education.</p>

<h3>The Start</h3>
<p>Samir then brought it up while in programming class together, and I was hooked.
  I agreed and suggested we get started right away.</p>
