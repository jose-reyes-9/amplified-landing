<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to our about page! I am Jose Reyes, and this is my
partner Samir Bawezir, together we have created Amplified. We are both students
at Woodbridge Senior High School, and we started developing Amplified our
sophomore year. It has been a long journey, but we are still far from done. Below,
you can read the story of Amplified, as well as our individual descriptions!</p>

<h1>The Story of Amplified</h1>
<br />

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>Samir came up with the idea after hearing countless students complain about
  their learning environments, and how little say they have in their education.</p>
<p>We wanted to create something that gave students a powerful voice, but more
importantly a constructive one. The last thing we wanted to do was make a bad
situation worse by creating a 'twitter like' rant page. We wanted unbaised blogs
that would spark educated and constructive discussions to find solutions.</p>

<h3>The Start</h3>
<p>Samir then brought it up while in programming class together, and I was hooked.
  I agreed with his idea and suggested we get started right away. That night we
  began, starting by learning the programming languages of the web which we quickly
  reaized were going to be imperative to our success.</p>

<h3>The Steps</h3>
<p>After many sleepless nights, and many hours on the phone with godaddy, we
  felt lost. We needed some sort of direction. We scheduled a meeting with two
  board memebers from our county, and we met with them at starbucks.</p>

<h3>The People</h3>
<p>The most important part of our project were the those who believed in us, they
  guided us...</p>

<h3>The Present</h3>
<p>We currently...</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>We hope to implement Amplified in many states when we...</p>
