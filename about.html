<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to our about page! We are two student named Jose
  Reyes and Samir Bawezir, together we have created Amplified. We currently
  attend Woodbridge Senior High School, and we started developing Amplified our
  sophomore year. It has been a long journey, but we are still far from done.
  Below, you can read the story of Amplified, as well as our individual
  descriptions!</p>

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>Samir came up with the idea after hearing countless students complain about
  their learning environments, and how little say they have in their education.
</p>

<p>We wanted to create something that gave students a powerful voice, but more
importantly a constructive one. The last thing we wanted to do was make a bad
situation worse by creating a 'twitter like' rant page. We wanted unbaised blogs
that would spark educated and constructive discussions to find solutions.</p>

<h3>The Start</h3>
<p>Samir then brought it up while in programming class together, and I was
  hooked. I agreed with his idea and suggested we get started right away. That
  night we began, starting by learning the programming languages of the web
  which we quickly reaized were going to be imperative to our success. Although both
  of our roles overlaped with each other, Samir was the mastermind behind how the
  infrasturcture would work while I was the brain behind the website. Toghther,
  we were able to create a website that was so aesthetically pleasing that when
  we presented to one of the school board members, they were amazed what two kids
  could do.</p>

<h3>The Steps</h3>
<p>After many sleepless nights, and many hours on the phone with godaddy, we
  felt lost. We needed some sort of direction. We scheduled a meeting with two
  board memebers from our county, and we met with them at starbucks.</p>

<h3>The People</h3>
<p>The most important part of our project were the those who believed in us,
  they guided us...</p>

<h3>The Present</h3>
<p>We currently working with Woodbridge High School as a project school. </p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>We hope to implement Amplified in many states when we...</p>
