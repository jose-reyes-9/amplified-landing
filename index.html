<h1>What do we do?</h1>
<p>Amplified gives students a voice to better learning environments. How do we
  do that you ask? Well Amplified first partners up with your school and gathers
  neccessary data to begin writing blogs.
</p>

<h1>What Data?</h1>
<p>The data consists of friendly and anonymous surveys that allow students to
  express their true feelings for their school. This allows us to tailor our
  blogs specifically for your school in order to fix your problems, and improve
  not only the school environment, but the level of the education you provide.
</p>

<h1>Why do we do this?</h1>
<p>Studies show that school environments kill creativity and disengage students
  from true learning. Students in schools do not learn the material, but instead
  memorize it. Learning is something that comes natural to humans, but schools
  have mad it impossible for students to love learning.
</p>

<h1>Small steps for giant leaps</h1>
<p>Schools must be willing to change small customs in order to become more
  productive and efficient. The numbers prove our system works, and this will
  change education forever. The future is bright as long as we can adapt to the
  evolution of learning by allowing our students to love education again.
